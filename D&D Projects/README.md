# D&D Projects
This directory contains a character sheet manager/dice roller written in Python.

My goals for this program is to have a fully-independent program for managing all features in relation to tracking character's equipment and abilities, spells and spell slots if the character can use any, and capability to create new characters along with leveling up existing characters.
